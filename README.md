### description:

The dashboard will consist of a single page in which 3-5 graphs will be arranged side by side to show the correlations and proportions relevant to answering our research questions, specifically they will focus on severity/number of collisions (Y axis) over time/airport/state/company (X axis).

These graphs will be customizable across two (main) variables: 
- The first will be the variables shown on the axisâ€™s of the graph - an example of this being switching between Year and Month along the X axis of the heatmap, allowing for a change over the years perspective, or alternatively a yearly cycle perspective. - The other will be options to highlight certain subgroups within the data, by either filtering out or highlighting in colour the relavent sub-groups. This will allow the user to visually see how the different times of day, or companies within a yearly scatter plot correlate with this like severity of damage or frequency of accidents.
