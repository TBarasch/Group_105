# DSCI 532 App Creation - Group 105

created by: Evhen Dytyniak, Tani Barasch, and Robert Pimentel  
  
### Description:  
  
The dashboard will consist of 3-5 graphs which will be arranged side by side to show the correlations and proportions relevant to answering our research questions found in the [project proposal](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Group_105/blob/master/project_proposal.md). The graphs will focus on interactively representing the severity/number of bird strikes over several continuous and categorical variables (time, state, flight phase, etc.).

These graphs will be customizable across variables that may effect bird strikes:  

- One example is the ability to customize the time scale of the graphs; an example of this is switching between Year and Month along the X axis of the heatmap, allowing for a change over the year's perspective, or alternatively a yearly cycle perspective.  

- Another options is to highlight certain subgroups within the data, either by filtering out or highlighting in the colour of the relavent sub-groups. This will allow the user to visually see how the different factors/subgroups (times of day, flight phase, etc) relate to bird strikes.
