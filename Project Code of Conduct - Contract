General Expectations:
    • Anyone who wants to put in extra effort beyond the agreed/needed amount should feel free to do so but can not require others to follow suit.
    • Decisions to me made in democratic consensus
Communication 
    • Shared slack channel or text, not phone calls (unless your a psycho)
    • Respond to group questions/issues even if only to agree
    • If some issue arises that could affects the project, let everyone know so we can adjust asap
Scheduling 
    • Schedule meetings such that the next two are always planned.
    • Avoid meeting on Sundays as much as possible
    • Meetings should, preferably, take place during lunch hour and/or lab time.
    • Informal agenda at least 5 min before meeting
Work assignment
    • Delegate and divide the work such that it can be done individually as much as possible
